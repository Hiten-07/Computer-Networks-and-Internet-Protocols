 Definition:
  A protocol is a controlled sequence of messages exchanged between two or more systems to accomplish a task.

• Specifications: 
  These define the sequence, format, and layout of messages so that receiving parties can decipher the data.

• Encapsulation:
  As data moves down the stack, it is "piggybacked" or becomes the payload for the layer below it.
  For example, application data receives a TCP header (Transport), then an IP header (Network), and finally an Ethernet header and trailer (Data Link) before physical transmission.
