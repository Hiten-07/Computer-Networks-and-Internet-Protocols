The internet evolved from early telegraphy into a global packet-switching network through several key milestones:

• Early Foundations (1836–1876): The telegraph used Morse Code (dots and dashes), which shares an analogy with modern binary 0s and 1s.
  Telephone exchanges later provided the backbone for internet connections.
• ARPA and Sputnik (1957): The US formed the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) to bolster computer technology following the USSR's launch of Sputnik.
• The Birth of ARPANET (1962–1969): ARPANET was designed for resilient and reliable connectivity.
  It was commissioned with four nodes: UCLA, SRI, UCSB, and the University of Utah.
• Protocol Standardisation (1974–1982): TCP was specified in 1974, and by 1982, the TCP/IP suite was established as the official protocol for ARPANET.
• The Web Revolution (1989–1998): Tim Berners-Lee coined the WWW concept in 1989.
  Browsers like Mosaic (1993) led to an explosion of hosts, reaching 110 million by 2001. 
  Google was founded in 1998.
