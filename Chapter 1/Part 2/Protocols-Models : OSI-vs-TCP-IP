The course compares the theoretical OSI model with the practical TCP/IP stack:
• OSI Model (7 Layers): Includes Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session (manages connections), Presentation (formatting/encryption), and Application.
• TCP/IP Suite (4 or 5 Layers): This is the dominant standard for inter-networking.
  It typically maps its Application layer to cover the OSI's top three layers (Session, Presentation, and Application).
