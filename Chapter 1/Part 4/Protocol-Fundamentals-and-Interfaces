A protocol defines the rules for communication between layers within the same system and between peer systems. Every protocol object has two primary interfaces:
• Service Interface: Defines the operations a higher layer can perform on the protocol.
• Peer-to-Peer Interface: Specifies the format and structure of messages exchanged with a remote peer.
