Data is broken into small chunks called packets (typically 1000 octets), each containing user data and control information for routing.

• Store and Forward: Each node receives a packet, buffers it briefly, and then passes it to the next node.

• Advantages:
    ◦ Line Efficiency: A single link can be shared by many packets over time.
    ◦ Data Rate Conversion: Nodes can buffer data to equalise different speeds between stations.
    ◦ Prioritisation: Specific packets can be given higher priority.
