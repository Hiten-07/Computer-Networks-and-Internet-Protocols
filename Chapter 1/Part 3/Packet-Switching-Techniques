1. Datagram Approach:
    ◦ Each packet is treated independently and can take any practical route.
    ◦ Packets may arrive out of order, be delayed, or lost.
    ◦ The receiver is responsible for re-ordering and recovering missing packets.

2. Virtual Circuit (VC) Approach:
    ◦ A preplanned route is established via a "handshake" before data is sent.
    ◦ Packets use a Virtual Circuit Identifier (VCI) instead of a full destination address.
    ◦ Forwarding is faster as no individual routing decisions are needed per packet.
